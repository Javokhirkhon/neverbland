### Notes

1. **Image Optimization**

   - Acknowledged the trade-off between using width/height constraints for performance and responsiveness. Usually, larger images are optimized on the backend side with considerations for appropriate width, height, and quality settings.

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Recognized that pushing environment files directly to the Git repository is generally considered a bad practice. Typically, these files are added to .gitignore, and environment variables are configured on the server side. For the sake of convenience and to facilitate your review, the environment file has been included in the repository.
